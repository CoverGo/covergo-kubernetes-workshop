# Part 3 - Deployments

In this part we are trying to tackle an issue that happened to us during the last part. 
We want to avoid our pod to disapear during a crash, this is the job of the **deployment controller**.

A kubernetes controller is simply a control loop that check if the state you wish has converged.
When using a deployment you will get access to the following features:

 - auto restart
 - rolling update
 - scaling (can increase the number of pods created)

Those 3 feature are the converged state that the deployment controller is trying to achieve for every 
deployment resource.

## Improving the existing

Like the last exercise, run the following command

        kubectl apply -f manifest/deployment.yaml

And run `kubectl get pod`, you will see the deployed pods, an ID is concatenated to the pod name
and automatically generated by deployment controller.

## Experimenting

Try to change the number of replicas from 1 to 3 inside the yaml file and run the command again:

        kubectl apply -f manifest/deployment.yaml

## Build more understanding

- What is Liveness probe and Readiness probe? Try to change the port used to see what happen
- Why there is a selector in the deployment spec field?
